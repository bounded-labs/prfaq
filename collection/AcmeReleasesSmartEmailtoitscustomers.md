# Acme Releases Smart Email to its customers

## Acme's smart email tool uses predictive text to make writing emails 10 times faster

Acme is excited to announce the addition of smart predictive text to our email products. The new capability, \'93Smart Email\'94, suggests the next few words in a sentence while a customer is typing that email. The customer can hit Enter or Tab to accept those words, rather than manually typing each one. Because many of the emails that we write tend have a lot of repeated text, this can make composing emails up to 10 times faster. With Acme Smart Email, you can focus on what is unique and important in your email, leaving the rote parts to the smart suggestions.

Writing emails is a repetitive task and throughout the day, many people type some phrases over and over again. Existing solutions with acronyms and templates have severe shortcomings. Acronyms can create confusion or make an email appear rushed and impolite. Many people use templates for emails, but templates can be inefficient to edit: by the time someone has clicked on the template in a few different places to change the text, it might have been quicker and easier to manually type the entire email from scratch.

Smart Email solves the problem of creating long-form emails efficiently by removing the redundancy in your typing. If you start typing a sentence, then Smart Email might suggest something and you only need to hit a single key to add those words to your email. Smart Email will also learn your style. For example, if you sign off emails with best or kind regards, or if you spell it color or colour, Smart Email will start to learn your stylistic preferences and adapt to those styles.

Acme Email users can start using this feature today. When you start composing your emails within a browser or on our iOS and Android applications, you will now see suggestions for the next few words that you might want to type.\

"3We are excited to help our customers become much more efficient," said Will Canis-La Trans, VP of Product at Acme Communication Technologies. "With Acme Smart Email, we are releasing the first of many Machine Learning-driven features to make a more delightful product experience."

"Smart Email is saving us hundreds of hours of work every week!" said Via Velox, Director of Marketing at Geo Coccyx. "Smart Email became my team's new favorite tool. After just a few days it learned my style and was suggesting content that sounded natural and was composed exactly right for our style-guides!"
