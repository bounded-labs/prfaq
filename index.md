## What is a PRFAQ?

PRFAQ stands for Press Release, Frequently Asked Questions. 

## What is a PRFAQ used for?

Popularized by Amazon, a PRFAQ is used as a way to define and test ideal product outcomes before any work is done.

*   Start from an understanding of who your customer is.
*   Identify common questions that your customer would have about your product (FAQs). 
*   Draft your press release using one of the examples or the general template below as a reference. 
*   Use this PRFAQ to discuss this "product" with stakeholders and customers, gathering qualitative feedback. 
*   Consider creating a landing page and/or to gather quantitative insight on the idea.

Limit each press release section of your PRFAQ to 4-5 sentences.

## Examples of PRFAQs:
